# DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate

My code for [this course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice).

I mistaken thought enrolling in this course was giving me access to all DeepLearning.AI stuff on Coursera, which turned out not to be true. But, getting started learning how to do basics with Tensorflow has proven to be somewhat useful to me.

In my next course I hope to learn how to choose which layers you should use in a deep neural network, which activation functions should be used in which cases, the ins-and-outs of optimizers, hyperparameter tuning, and so on, and not just rote experimentation with a particular ML framework.

I put my code in random Python files, copied from lecture notes.
