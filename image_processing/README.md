# Digital Image Processing

I'm primarily interested in doing Computer Vision, and much of that is converting digital images from various image formats into matrices or tensors of numbers you can feed into a model. 

In this directory I play around with various CV algorithms (like edge detection, etc) and test converting images to data.
